# Summer 2025 Reasearch Summary - Time-Interleaved ADC Calibrator Project

This repository documents my summer research contributions related to the FPGA side of the **Time-Interleaved (TI) ADC calibration project**.

## üìå Project Summary

The main objective of this project is to design and implement a **hardware calibration algorithm** that corrects **timing, gain, offset, and bandwidth mismatches** in high-speed TI ADCs.  

The approach involves injecting a **reference dither signal** into each time-interleaved channel to assist in calibration. By recognizing the peak and ideal amplitude of the dither signal, the calibration model gradually tunes ADC parameters using a **negative feedback loop**, ultimately correcting mismatches and improving overall ADC performance.
